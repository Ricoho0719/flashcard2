            {

                question: "The student concludes that the lights are LEDs and not filament bulbs. Explain why this conclusion is justified.",

                answer: "Filament bulbs have increasing resistance as current increases. But this graph shows opposite. Resistance is inverse gradient of I/V graph."

            },

            {

                question: "Each lamp is marked 1.5 V and two 1.5 V cells of negligible internal resistance are used as a power supply. The two lamps labelled A and B light with normal brightness when the switch is open. Explain what will happen to the brightness of each lamp when the switch is closed.",

                answer: "B is brighter and A is dimmer. A and C are the same brightness. Resistant of parallel combination decreases. p.d. across B increases OR p.d. across A (or C) decreases. p.d. across A = p.d. across C."

            },

            {

                question: "(i) Sketch a current-potential difference graph for a filament lamp on the axes below. (ii) Explain the shape of this graph in terms of electron movement through the lattice.",

                answer: "Temperature increase with increasing current. There is an increase in ion vibrations. Greater rate of collision between ions. Rate of increase of current with p.d. decrease."

            },

            {

                question: "Explain how this circuit provides the variable output for the buzzer.",

                answer: "This is a potential divider circuit. p.d. depends on the ratio of resistance. p.d. increase as slider move from C to A."

            },

            {

                question: "Explain, in terms of conduction electrons, why the resistance increases with the length of the wire.",

                answer: "Increase number of collision. Causing a decrease in velocity. Decrease current for same p.d. so resistance increase."

            },

            {

                question: "Describe how should student measure the diameter of the wire accurately as possible.",

                answer: "Use a micrometer. Take measurements in different positions. Calculate the average."

            },

            {

                question: "Describe what happens to the resistance of the LED as the p.d. across it increase from 0 V.",

                answer: "Initially the resistance is very high. Once current flows the resistance decreases rapidly."

            },

            {

                question: "Explain why the voltmeter should only be connected directly across the load resistor if the ammeter has negligible resistance.",

                answer: "There will be a p.d. across it. The voltmeter will be measuring a reduced value."

            },

            {

                question: "Explain why it is reasonable that this filament lamp reached a constant temperature after 180ms.",

                answer: "The p.d. becomes constant. So resistance and hence the temperature becomes constant."

            },

            {

                question: "The mean velocity of the free electrons in a current carrying conductor. Explain why drift velocity is defined as a mean velocity.",

                answer: "Electrons change direction. Due to collisions with ions."

            },

            {

                question: "State the advantage of using the potential divider circuit.",

                answer: "The p.d. across component can be zero."

            },

            {

                question: "Two cylinders of conducting putty are connected in parallel across a battery. The cylinder have the same length but different cross-sectional areas. Explain why the cylinder with the larger cross-sectional area will reach a higher temperature than the other cylinder.",

                answer: "Cylinder with larger area has a lower resistance. V is constant. Refers to so greater power."

            },

            {

                question: "Explain why it is more accurate to use an ohmmeter than a separate ammeter and voltmeter.",

                answer: "With two meters, both readings need to be taken at the same time. If not, the values will not match."

            },

            {

                question: "A student suggests that the drift velocity will double if the length of wire used in the circuit is halved. Comment on the suggestion.",

                answer: "Halving length halves resistance. Which doubles the current. Related to drift velocity doubling."

            },

            {

                question: "Explain how the p.d. across the discharge tube causes photons to be emitted by the gas atoms.",

                answer: "The potential difference causes a current in the gas. Energy is transferred to the gas atoms. Electron gains energy to move up energy levels. Electron exist in certain energy levels so only certain wavelengths are emitted. An electron falls back down emitting a photon."

            },

            {

                question: "The headlight will emit light when it dissipates at least 35 W of power. Determine the minimum potential for which the headlight will emit light.",

                answer: "Corresponding values from best fit line. Use of P = V²/R. Minimum potential difference = 9.0 V."

                answer: "The resistance of the LDR increases, (so the current decreases). The resistance of the LDR increases, so the LDR has a greater p.d. So the p.d. across the fixed resistor decreases (dependent on MP1)."

                question: "Explain how adding panels in parallel changes the power output of the system.",

                answer: "The same potential difference is applied across additional panel. So each panel dissipates the same power, and power output of the system increases. As more panels are connected, the resistance (of the system) decreases (and potential difference remains the same. As more panels are connected, the current in the power supply increases (and potential difference across each panel is the same)."

                answer: "Any 2 reasons with explanations - For example: 1) Internal resistance of the battery causes voltage drop. 2) Resistance in the connecting wires reduces the voltage measured at the component."
